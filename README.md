# Credit-Card-Approval-System
Abstract
The goal of this project is to estimate customer credit card eligibility using machine
learning (ML) techniques in order to mitigate future credit risk that could negatively
impact the bank's credit performance and financial stability. A credit card is a type of
credit facility that banks and other financial institutions offer to their customers
worldwide. The credit facility exposes banks and other financial entities to credit risk.
There is rarely a guarantee on repayments, and the loan often ends up as a non-
performing credit facility (NPL). Banks evaluate applicants' eligibility and
creditworthiness prior to granting a credit facility in an effort to lower credit risk
